# Timeline placement

Issue-driven. Milestones never carry dependencies on each other — a milestone-level link
rots the moment one issue unblocks and the rest are still coupled.

`scripts/timeline.sh` (read-only) proposes; the agent applies `due_on` after the owner
confirms when anything is ambiguous.

1. Gather every open milestone's issues with their estimates and `blocked by` links
   (including links that cross milestones), and whether each milestone has **started**
   (any issue assigned, in progress or merged).
2. Per milestone: critical path through its own issues' dependencies using est. cycle
   days; total effort; projected duration = critical path adjusted by the observed
   parallelism (from history: median concurrent In-progress issues; default 1.5).
3. Place: started milestones are **pinned** at their actual start; a milestone the owner
   is starting now begins **today** and overlaps whatever is running; unstarted
   milestones are laid out serially after the last scheduled one unless an issue
   dependency forces a different order. Existing `due_on` order breaks ties.
4. When two unstarted milestones have no dependency between them and no prior order,
   **ask the owner** which comes first.
5. Report: milestone → start, projected end, critical path length, effort, parallelism
   used, and the sample sizes behind the numbers. Apply `due_on` where it moved by more
   than a day.

`--resequence <milestones>` runs the same steps for the named milestones only, holding
everything else fixed.
